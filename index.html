# The Zen of Python

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import this

```

---

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- **Explicit is better than implicit.**
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- **Flat is better than nested.**
- Sparse is better than dense.
- **Readability counts.**
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- **Errors should never pass silently.**
- Unless explicitly silenced.

---

- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- **Although never is often better than *right* now.**
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- **If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.**
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
