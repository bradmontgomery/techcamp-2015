The python programming language is a popular, multi-paradigm, general purpose
programming language, and in recent years, it’s popularity has grown. There are
many who advocate using python as a “first language” for learning computer
programming, and many universities and online training courses have adopted
python as their language of choice.

But aside from using python as a learning language, what are people actually
building with python? This talk presents a broad spectrum of projects–some of
them quirky & some of them serious–that highlights some of the interesting
things people do with python. You’ll walk away from this session with a better
idea of what’s possible with this fun, flexible programming language.
